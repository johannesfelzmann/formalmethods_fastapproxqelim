abstract = {This is a brief summary and exposition of the paper "Quantifier Elimination for Real Closed Fields by Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition," which was presented at the Second GI Conference on Automata Theory and Formal Languages, University of Kaiserslautern, May 1975, and which appears in the proceedings of that conference, <u>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</u>, Vol. 33 (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1975, pages 134--183). A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the EUROSAM 74 Conference, Stockholm, July 1974, and appears in the proceedings of that conference, <u>SIGSAM Bulletin</u>, Vol. 8, No. 3 (August 1974), pages 30--90. The final version of the paper includes a rather detailed analysis of the computing time of the algorithm, which was omitted from the preliminary version In addition, the final version describes several significant improvements to the algorithm of the earlier version.},

abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.  This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.  We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},
